### Overview

Welcome to Plaid's Tiny Quickstart! This repo contains five folders: **vanilla_js/**, **vanilla_typescript/**, **nextjs/**, **react/**, and **react_native/**. Each folder contains a minimal full-stack app that implements support end-to-end for one Plaid product endpoint.

To get started, clone the repository, `cd` into one of the folders, and follow the instructions in the corresponding **README**. Enjoy! 

```
git clone https://github.com/plaid/tiny-quickstart.git && cd ./tiny-quickstart
```

If you're looking for a more fully-featured quickstart, covering more API endpoints, available in more languages, and with explanations of the underlying flows, see the official [Plaid Quickstart](https://www.plaid.com/docs/quickstart).
